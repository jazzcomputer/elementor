As well as for displaying forms and messaging, Modal popups are really useful for displaying content. An example might be a single page artist's portfolio site that opens modals when the items are clicked on.
Some things that would be useful in the modal feature:
Allow modal to display full functioning templates or posts. This would require the content to be correcetly initialized and avoid problems with carousel buttons not working.
Allow scrolling within the modal, but make sure it ONLY scrolls in the modal and doesn't scroll the body. Modals present a huge problem with this from what I understand. 
Provide control over the placement of the close button(s) in the modal.
Allow sticky menus within the modal that work correclty.
Provide Static header and footer for scrolling content. 
Provide advanced placement and sizing of the modal relative to the screen size / format.
